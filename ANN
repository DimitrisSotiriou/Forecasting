The nnfor (development version here) package for R facilitates time series forecasting with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM). 
Currently (version 0.9.6) it does not support deep learning, though the plan is to extend this to this direction in the near future. 
Currently, it relies on the neuralnet package for R, which provides all the machinery to train MLPs. 
The training of ELMs is written within the nnfor package. 
Note that since neuralnet cannot tap on GPU processing, large networks tend to be very slow to train. 
nnfor differs from existing neural network implementations for R in that it provides code to automatically 
design networks with reasonable forecasting performance, but also provide in-depth control to the experienced user. The automatic specification is designed with parsimony in mind. This increases the robustness of the resulting networks, but also helps reduce the training time.
